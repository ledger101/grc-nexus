## Phases



### Phase 1: Foundation â”œÃ³Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥ Authentication, RLS, and Audit Trail

**Goal:** Users can securely log in with institutional roles, and all governance data operations are immutably logged.

**Depends on:** None (first phase)

**Requirements:** AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, AUTH-04, AUTH-05, AUTH-06, AUTH-07, AUTH-08, TRAIL-01, TRAIL-02, TRAIL-03, TRAIL-04

**Success Criteria:**

1. User can create account with email/password and is assigned an institutional role (admin, board-member, ceo, risk-officer, audit-officer, or dept-head)

2. User can log in and remain authenticated across browser sessions without re-entering credentials

3. User can log out from any page and is immediately logged out everywhere

4. Privileged users (admin, board-member) are blocked from sensitive workflows without MFA enabled

5. Every governance action (create, update, delete) is recorded in an immutable audit log visible to admins and audit officers

6. Supabase Row-Level Security enforces access control at database layer, not only in application code

7. User can only see data belonging to their own institution; cross-institution queries are blocked at RLS layer

### Phase 14: Advanced Analytics — Forecasting, Anomaly Detection, and Data Export

**Goal:** The platform surfaces predictive KPI/KRI forecasts, anomaly detection alerts, and provides analytics-grade structured data export — without requiring an external Python/R runtime for the initial delivery.

**Depends on:** Phase 9 (KRI/KCI readings), Phase 2 (KPI readings data)

**Requirements:** BRIDGE-ANA-01, BRIDGE-ANA-02, BRIDGE-ANA-03, BRIDGE-ANA-04

**Success Criteria:**

1. KPI and KRI detail pages display a simple linear regression forecast band for the next 2 periods based on the last 4–6 readings, rendered as a Recharts ReferenceLine range above the trend sparkline

2. A background cron job runs daily and detects KPI/KRI readings that deviate more than 2 standard deviations from the trailing 6-period mean; detected anomalies insert notification records and send Resend email alerts to the metric owner

3. Admin can download a structured CSV export for each module (risks, KPIs, KRIs, KCIs, obligations, findings, incidents, board actions, ESG metrics) from a new Analytics Export admin page; exports are institution-scoped via RLS

4. The Analytics Export page documents the available endpoints and data schemas so that external R or Python workflows can consume the exports (no runtime integration required in this phase — documentation and clean export format is the deliverable)

**UI hint**: yes

**Status:** ✅ Complete (2026-05-25)

**Plans:** 5/5 plans executed
