## Phases



### Phase 1: Foundation â”œÃ³Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥ Authentication, RLS, and Audit Trail

**Goal:** Users can securely log in with institutional roles, and all governance data operations are immutably logged.

**Depends on:** None (first phase)

**Requirements:** AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, AUTH-04, AUTH-05, AUTH-06, AUTH-07, AUTH-08, TRAIL-01, TRAIL-02, TRAIL-03, TRAIL-04

**Success Criteria:**

1. User can create account with email/password and is assigned an institutional role (admin, board-member, ceo, risk-officer, audit-officer, or dept-head)

2. User can log in and remain authenticated across browser sessions without re-entering credentials

3. User can log out from any page and is immediately logged out everywhere

4. Privileged users (admin, board-member) are blocked from sensitive workflows without MFA enabled

5. Every governance action (create, update, delete) is recorded in an immutable audit log visible to admins and audit officers

6. Supabase Row-Level Security enforces access control at database layer, not only in application code

7. User can only see data belonging to their own institution; cross-institution queries are blocked at RLS layer

**UI hint**: yes

**Plans:** 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Incident schema/RLS/trigger migrations + incident types + Zod schemas + utility contracts
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Incident server actions + queries + escalation service + intake/escalate API routes
- [x] 07-03-PLAN.md — Intake UI (named/anonymous report form) + submission confirmation flow
- [x] 07-04-PLAN.md — Investigator dashboard/list/detail + triage assignment + status/closure workflow UI

2. Each objective has a current status (On Track, At Risk, Off Track) visible in the management interface

3. Admin can create KPIs linked to an objective with baseline value, target value, unit of measure, and reporting frequency

4. KPI owners can record period readings (actual value, timestamp, notes) without deleting previous readings

5. System automatically calculates KPI performance status (On Track / At Risk / Off Track) based on actual vs. target progress

6. Dashboard displays a KPI summary grid showing all institution KPIs with color-coded status and trend indicators

**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 3: Enterprise Risk Management â”œÃ³Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥ Risk Register and Heatmap

**Goal:** Risk officers can create and score risks linked to strategic objectives, record mitigations, and see a live 5â”œÃ¢-5 risk heatmap.

**Depends on:** Phase 2 (strategic objectives provide risk context)

**Requirements:** RISK-01, RISK-02, RISK-03, RISK-04, RISK-05, RISK-06, RISK-07, RISK-08

**Success Criteria:**

1. User can create a risk entry linked to a strategic objective with title, description, category, and owner

2. User can score a risk on a 5â”œÃ¢-5 likelihood-impact matrix (1â”œÃ³Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£5 scale each dimension) for inherent risk

3. User can record residual risk score after applying mitigating controls and see the change reflected immediately

4. System calculates risk score (likelihood â”œÃ¢- impact) and applies severity labels (Low 1â”œÃ³Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£4, Medium 5â”œÃ³Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£9, High 10â”œÃ³Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£15, Critical 16â”œÃ³Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£25)

5. User can add risk treatments (mitigation actions) with owner, due date, and status; overdue treatments trigger escalation to owner and manager

6. Risk register is filterable by category, severity, owner, and status without page reload

7. Dashboard displays a live 5â”œÃ¢-5 risk heatmap showing all institutional risks positioned by inherent score with color-coded severity zones

**UI hint**: yes



---
