# GRC-Nexus State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-05-22)

**Core value:** A governance officer or board member can log in, see their institution's live risk posture and strategic KPI performance, and act on overdue obligations — all in one place, with a full audit trail.

**Current focus:** Phase 02 — strategic-planning-objectives-and-kpis

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Foundation — Authentication, RLS, and Audit Trail**

**Goal:** Users can securely log in with institutional roles, and all governance data operations are immutably logged.

**Requirements:** AUTH-01 through AUTH-08, TRAIL-01 through TRAIL-04 (12 total)

**Status:** Ready to plan

**Started:** —

**Completed:** —

**Key deliverables:**

- Supabase authentication system with email/password sign-up and login
- Institutional roles (admin, board-member, ceo, risk-officer, audit-officer, dept-head)
- Row-Level Security policies on all tables
- MFA requirement for privileged users
- Postgres trigger-based immutable audit trail table
- User session management across browser tabs

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Phase 1 completion | Week 1 | — |
| Cumulative requirements met | 44/44 | 0/44 |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

1. **8 phases using fine granularity** — complexity of multi-module GRC platform requires natural delivery boundaries
2. **Phase 1 includes audit trail** — immutable logging cannot be retrofitted per research findings
3. **Dependency-driven order** — Phase 2 (strategy) depends on Phase 1 (auth); Phase 3 (risk) depends on Phase 2 (objectives provide risk context)
4. **Next.js 14 App Router + Supabase** — fixed tech stack from PROJECT.md
5. **Single-institution scope for prototype** — validates core workflows before multi-tenant complexity

### Risk Flags

- **Audit trail immutability:** Must implement Postgres SECURITY DEFINER triggers in Phase 1; cannot retrofit
- **RLS on all tables:** Enable from schema creation; 170+ Supabase apps were exposed in 2025 due to disabled RLS
- **Risk scoring calibration:** Rubric (what = likelihood 4?) needs domain expert input before Phase 3 population
- **Cache poisoning:** All authenticated routes need `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent ISR data leakage

### Research Insights

- Stack is validated: shadcn/ui + Nivo (only library with native 5×5 heatmap) + Recharts + TanStack Table v9
- Critical pitfalls documented: immutability, RLS, risk calibration, cache, evidence storage
- Build order is dependency-driven: Auth → Strategy → Risk → Compliance → Board → Audit → Incidents → Dashboard
- Table stakes (immutable audit, RBAC at DB layer, risk heatmap, KPI tracking) are non-negotiable for auditor credibility

### Open Questions

| Question | Phase | Owner |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Risk scoring rubric calibration | Phase 3 | Domain expert workshop needed |
| PECOGA statutory report template format | Phase 8 | Reference actual PECOGA filings |
| Compliance officer UX pain points | Phase 4 | User interviews required |
| Data retention periods (PPDPA) | Phase 4 | Legal input |
| Multi-role user handling | Phase 1 | Client institutional policy |

### Blockers

(None at kickoff)

### Todos

- [ ] Validate risk scoring rubric with domain experts before Phase 3 planning
- [ ] Secure 3-5 compliance officer user interviews for Phase 4 UX
- [ ] Get sample PECOGA filings to understand statutory report format for Phase 8
- [ ] Confirm PPDPA data retention requirements for Phase 4 evidence storage
- [ ] Clarify multi-role user assignment policy (can one user have board + risk-officer?)

## Session Continuity

**Last updated:** 2026-05-22 (roadmap creation)

**What happened:** 

- Parsed PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, research/SUMMARY.md, config.json
- Derived 8 phases following research build order and dependency analysis
- Mapped all 44 v1 requirements to phases (100% coverage)
- Derived 2-5 observable success criteria per phase (goal-backward methodology)
- Created ROADMAP.md (with UI hints on all phases), STATE.md, and updated REQUIREMENTS.md traceability

**Next step:** `/gsd-plan-phase 1` to decompose Phase 1 Foundation into executable plans
