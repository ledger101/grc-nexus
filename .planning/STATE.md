# GRC-Nexus State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-05-22)

**Core value:** A governance officer or board member can log in, see their institution's live risk posture and strategic KPI performance, and act on overdue obligations — all in one place, with a full audit trail.

**Current focus:** Phase 8 complete — prepare milestone closeout and verification sweep

## Current Phase

**Phase 8: Executive Dashboard and Reporting — Unified Governance View**

**Goal:** Deliver executive governance dashboard and reporting exports across modules.

**Requirements:** RPT-01, RPT-02, RPT-03, RPT-04

**Status:** Ready to execute

**Started:** 2026-05-23

**Completed:** 2026-05-23

**Key deliverables:**

- Consolidated dashboard with KPI/risk/compliance/overdue action widgets
- URL-persisted filters for time period, department, and module
- Governance PDF export endpoint and dashboard download action
- Module/department-aware audit filtering with export parity

## Performance Metrics

(To be populated as phases complete)

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Phase 6 completion | Week 6 | ✅ Complete |
| Cumulative requirements met | 44/44 | 37/37 plans |
| Phase 06 P05 | 88 min | 14 tasks / 23 files |
| Phase 8 P04 | 5400 | 7 tasks | 16 files |
| Phase 5 complete | 2026-05-23 | 6 plans / board lifecycle delivered |
| Phase 14-advanced-analytics-forecasting-anomaly-detection-and-data-export P02 | 160 | 2 tasks | 3 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

1. **8 phases using fine granularity** — complexity of multi-module GRC platform requires natural delivery boundaries
2. **Phase 1 includes audit trail** — immutable logging cannot be retrofitted per research findings
3. **Dependency-driven order** — Phase 2 (strategy) depends on Phase 1 (auth); Phase 3 (risk) depends on Phase 2 (objectives provide risk context)
4. **Next.js 14 App Router + Supabase** — fixed tech stack from PROJECT.md
5. **Single-institution scope for prototype** — validates core workflows before multi-tenant complexity
6. **Phase 6 audit module parity** — audit feature architecture mirrors compliance patterns for consistency and lower maintenance risk
7. **Auto-advance checkpoint policy applied** — plan 06-05 human-verify checkpoint auto-approved under `workflow.auto_advance=true`
8. **Phase 8 manual fallback execution** — planner quota limits bypassed using manual 08-plan authoring and inline execution
9. **Shared reporting contracts first** — dashboard and export features were built on common filter/query contracts to avoid scope drift
10. **Phase 8 verification checkpoint auto-approved** — plan 08-04 human-verify checkpoint auto-approved under `workflow.auto_advance=true`
11. **Phase 5 verification checkpoint auto-approved** — plan 05-06 human-verify checkpoint auto-approved under `workflow.auto_advance=true`
12. **Analytics export uses user client (not admin client)** — RLS enforces institution_id scoping automatically; admin client would leak cross-institution data (T-14-02)
13. **incidents module omits submitter_id** — anonymity requirement INCD-02; field excluded from CSV export schema

### Risk Flags

- **Audit trail immutability:** Must implement Postgres SECURITY DEFINER triggers in Phase 1; cannot retrofit
- **RLS on all tables:** Enable from schema creation; 170+ Supabase apps were exposed in 2025 due to disabled RLS
- **Risk scoring calibration:** Rubric (what = likelihood 4?) needs domain expert input before Phase 3 population
- **Cache poisoning:** All authenticated routes need `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent ISR data leakage

### Research Insights

- Stack is validated: shadcn/ui + Nivo (only library with native 5×5 heatmap) + Recharts + TanStack Table v9
- Critical pitfalls documented: immutability, RLS, risk calibration, cache, evidence storage
- Build order is dependency-driven: Auth → Strategy → Risk → Compliance → Board → Audit → Incidents → Dashboard
- Table stakes (immutable audit, RBAC at DB layer, risk heatmap, KPI tracking) are non-negotiable for auditor credibility

### Open Questions

| Question | Phase | Owner |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Risk scoring rubric calibration | Phase 3 | Domain expert workshop needed |
| PECOGA statutory report template format | Closed in prototype | Candidate for milestone 2 report refinement |
| Compliance officer UX pain points | Phase 4 | User interviews required |
| Data retention periods (PPDPA) | Phase 4 | Legal input |
| Multi-role user handling | Phase 1 | Client institutional policy |

### Blockers

(None at kickoff)

### Todos

- [ ] Validate risk scoring rubric with domain experts before Phase 3 planning
- [ ] Secure 3-5 compliance officer user interviews for Phase 4 UX
- [ ] Get sample PECOGA filings to understand statutory report format for Phase 8
- [ ] Confirm PPDPA data retention requirements for Phase 4 evidence storage
- [ ] Clarify multi-role user assignment policy (can one user have board + risk-officer?)

## Session Continuity

**Last updated:** 2026-05-25 (phase 14 plan 03 execution complete)

**What happened:** 

- Executed all phase 8 plans (08-01 through 08-04) with atomic task commits.
- Implemented reporting contracts, consolidated dashboard widgets, governance PDF export, and audit module/department filtering.
- Recorded auto-approved verification checkpoint for 08-04 in `08-VERIFICATION.md`.
- Executed phase 14 plan 01: Wave 0 TDD RED-phase test stubs for forecast and anomaly utilities.
- Created lib/analytics/forecast.test.ts (7 it() calls) and lib/analytics/anomaly.test.ts (7 it() calls).
- Both files confirmed failing (module-not-found) — correct RED state before Plan 02/04 implement the modules.
- Updated ROADMAP/REQUIREMENTS traceability for RPT-01 through RPT-04.
- Executed all phase 5 plans (05-01 through 05-06) with atomic task commits.
- Implemented board schema/RLS/triggers, backend action/query/escalation layer, and complete board meeting lifecycle UI.
- Recorded auto-approved verification checkpoint for 05-06 in `05-VERIFICATION.md`.
- Updated ROADMAP/REQUIREMENTS traceability for BOARD-01 through BOARD-06.
- Executed phase 14 plan 03: 9-module CSV export API route and analytics-export admin page.
- Created app/api/analytics/export/[module]/route.ts with ALLOWED_MODULES allowlist, admin-only RLS-scoped user client.
- Installed shadcn accordion (components/ui/accordion.tsx) and created app/(protected)/admin/analytics-export/page.tsx.
- tailwind.config.ts updated with accordion keyframes by shadcn CLI (all existing tokens preserved).
- Delivers BRIDGE-ANA-03 (downloadable CSV for 9 modules) and BRIDGE-ANA-04 (inline API documentation).

**Next step:** Execute phase 14 plan 04 (anomaly detection utility GREEN phase) or continue with remaining phase 14 plans.
