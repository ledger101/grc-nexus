# GRC-Nexus State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-05-22)

**Core value:** A governance officer or board member can log in, see their institution's live risk posture and strategic KPI performance, and act on overdue obligations — all in one place, with a full audit trail.

**Current focus:** Phase 7 — Incident and Whistleblower Management — Reporting and Triage

## Current Phase

**Phase 7: Incident and Whistleblower Management — Reporting and Triage**

**Goal:** Enable secure incident and whistleblower intake, triage, and tracked remediation workflows.

**Requirements:** INCIDENT and WHISTLE requirements (see `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`)

**Status:** Ready to plan

**Started:** —

**Completed:** —

**Key deliverables:**

- Incident report capture with role-safe intake channels
- Confidential whistleblower handling workflow
- Triage and ownership assignment controls
- Audit-safe status progression and evidence attachments

## Performance Metrics

(To be populated as phases complete)

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Phase 6 completion | Week 6 | ✅ Complete |
| Cumulative requirements met | 44/44 | 22/23 plans |
| Phase 06 P05 | 88 min | 14 tasks / 23 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

1. **8 phases using fine granularity** — complexity of multi-module GRC platform requires natural delivery boundaries
2. **Phase 1 includes audit trail** — immutable logging cannot be retrofitted per research findings
3. **Dependency-driven order** — Phase 2 (strategy) depends on Phase 1 (auth); Phase 3 (risk) depends on Phase 2 (objectives provide risk context)
4. **Next.js 14 App Router + Supabase** — fixed tech stack from PROJECT.md
5. **Single-institution scope for prototype** — validates core workflows before multi-tenant complexity
6. **Phase 6 audit module parity** — audit feature architecture mirrors compliance patterns for consistency and lower maintenance risk
7. **Auto-advance checkpoint policy applied** — plan 06-05 human-verify checkpoint auto-approved under `workflow.auto_advance=true`

### Risk Flags

- **Audit trail immutability:** Must implement Postgres SECURITY DEFINER triggers in Phase 1; cannot retrofit
- **RLS on all tables:** Enable from schema creation; 170+ Supabase apps were exposed in 2025 due to disabled RLS
- **Risk scoring calibration:** Rubric (what = likelihood 4?) needs domain expert input before Phase 3 population
- **Cache poisoning:** All authenticated routes need `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent ISR data leakage

### Research Insights

- Stack is validated: shadcn/ui + Nivo (only library with native 5×5 heatmap) + Recharts + TanStack Table v9
- Critical pitfalls documented: immutability, RLS, risk calibration, cache, evidence storage
- Build order is dependency-driven: Auth → Strategy → Risk → Compliance → Board → Audit → Incidents → Dashboard
- Table stakes (immutable audit, RBAC at DB layer, risk heatmap, KPI tracking) are non-negotiable for auditor credibility

### Open Questions

| Question | Phase | Owner |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Risk scoring rubric calibration | Phase 3 | Domain expert workshop needed |
| PECOGA statutory report template format | Phase 8 | Reference actual PECOGA filings |
| Compliance officer UX pain points | Phase 4 | User interviews required |
| Data retention periods (PPDPA) | Phase 4 | Legal input |
| Multi-role user handling | Phase 1 | Client institutional policy |

### Blockers

(None at kickoff)

### Todos

- [ ] Validate risk scoring rubric with domain experts before Phase 3 planning
- [ ] Secure 3-5 compliance officer user interviews for Phase 4 UX
- [ ] Get sample PECOGA filings to understand statutory report format for Phase 8
- [ ] Confirm PPDPA data retention requirements for Phase 4 evidence storage
- [ ] Clarify multi-role user assignment policy (can one user have board + risk-officer?)

## Session Continuity

**Last updated:** 2026-05-23 (phase 6 execution complete)

**What happened:** 

- Executed all phase 6 plans (06-01 through 06-05) with atomic task commits.
- Implemented audit schema, RLS, triggers, server actions, queries, escalation route, and protected UI routes.
- Added audit module navigation in protected layout and recorded auto-approved verification checkpoint.
- Updated ROADMAP and REQUIREMENTS progress for AUDIT-01 through AUDIT-05.

**Next step:** `/gsd-plan-phase 7` to decompose incident and whistleblower workflows.
